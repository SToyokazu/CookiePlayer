-rehosting the game, editing the sourcecode, dealing with bugs, and keeping up with the official version’s updates are your own responsibilities
-the page must have a paypal donate button leading to the same url as the official version’s
-the page must retain all the information in the top-bar (including credits), in addition to a link to the official version
-the page must not include advertisements; you are not allowed to make profits from the page
